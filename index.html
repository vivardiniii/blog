                            <p>In 2016, I packed up my life in the United States and moved to India for university. 
                            This isn’t one of those “Oh my god, I went to India and it CHANGED MY LIFE” type of writeups. 
                            It’s more of an exploration of some of the things I observed and learned from my time at university. 
                            For those of you curious to know what life is like on the other side of the globe, you may find this interesting. 
                            For my friends that are here because I sent this to you, I hope you’re able to push through my mediocre writing, but if not, it’s chill. 
                            Everything discussed here is solely from my time in the US and India. The people and experiences I mention by no means represent all South Asians or all South Asian Americans. </p>
                            <p>I was born and raised in the American South, and my parents, as most other immigrant parents, valiantly fought off the subtle yet constant pull to renounce their culture and assimilate. 
                            While they adapted to the American way of life, they kept their South Asian culture very alive at home. The no shoes inside the house policy, the relentless cleaning, the “what will other people think,” 
                            the several cups of chai a day, the constant bickering in Telugu, the emphasis on education but only the doctor, lawyer, engineer type education, the pujas, the Balavihar, the Maa TV, Gemini TV, and B4U Music 
                            raging through the day, and the many more things that all South Asian immigrant kids can relate to. 
                            My brother and I were by no means whitewashed, or at least that’s what I thought before moving to India. </p>
                            <p>The only real experience I’ve had with Indians from India were those that newly migrated to the US, or FOBs. FOB (fresh off the boat) refers to Asian immigrants, who travelled across the Pacific Ocean or Atlantic Ocean, 
                            looking for a better life in the West. Notable stereotypes include broken or accented English, naïveté to a fault, and just a general display of blatant ethnic-ness in a predominantly white society. 
                            Some examples include: the aunty at the grocery store in a salwar kameez, the clueless kid with an Indian accent in class, and the excited grad student ready to shoot his shot at the flawed American Dream.
                             Most use the word derogatorily, but a few do call themselves FOBs in attempt to reclaim the word. Within my friend circles, however, it was just a way to distance us Indian Americans from Indian Indians in a way that marked us more modern and progressive than them. 
                             I moved thinking that I knew all about India and Indian people.</p>
                             <p>The way most universities in India work is that the students of a major are grouped into classes. For a degree there may be 2-3 classes with about 70 students per class. Each class is assigned a classroom, and the teachers rotate every hour. 
                             This is the exact opposite of how classes are structured in the US. In high school, teachers had their own classrooms, and students moved from classroom to classroom every hour of the day with respect to their particular schedule. 
                             Each lecture that I attended in high school had a different set of students. In some lectures, I’d have all my friends around me to keep me company, but in other lectures, I didn’t know anyone. 
                             There’s a certain independence, travelling from class to class on your own, saying hello and goodbye to your different acquaintances at every hour in the day and keeping track of different exams, assignments, and projects all by yourself. 
                             In India, on the other hand, we’re all stuck together for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week for 4 entire years. Your class is your new family, so getting along with at least some people in your class is crucial for survival. </p>
                             <p>The first couple months of the semester, my guard was up high. I only initiated conversation when I had class related questions, and because I couldn’t understand anyone through the Indian accent, I only talked to people with good English. 
                             Even if people were speaking in English, sometimes I just couldn’t understand what they meant. If someone approached me, I’d politely make conversation, but I wasn’t completely myself. As I made small talk with those around me, I kept focusing on the blatant surface level differences-
                             the accent, the naïve questions about life in the US, the “how could anyone who lives in the West want to come to study here? It’s usually the opposite isn’t it?” Constant questions about my background distanced me from my peers and made me feel like there was no common ground to even start a friendship. 
                             Everyone was so different from me, so I felt like I didn’t have to genuinely open up to anyone because it wouldn’t lead anywhere anyway. And to be completely honest, more often than I’d like to admit, I definitely thought that I was better and cooler than everyone else, “How could I ever be friends with a bunch of FOBs?” </p>
                             <p>After the first three months of the semester, I moved into the hostel. I moved into the only vacant spot left, and none of my roommates were in my class, so they were essentially three complete strangers. My roommates were completely taken aback by my western lifestyle and attitude. 
                             They regularly glanced at my messy desk and bed and exchanged wary looks. They often talked about me in front of me in Malayalam. They took note of the fact that I didn’t shower and wash my hair every day and started gossiping to their friends. I just shrugged these things off and told myself that they just weren’t used to me 
                             and they’d soon get used to it, but honestly, I don’t think they ever did. Even after 4 years, nothing really changed. I kept my patience with them for the most part, but the one thing that did irk me, however, was their lack of communication. 
                             I often got called to the warden’s office only to learn that my roommates complained about me (to the warden) in order to get me to change my ways. Why couldn’t they just talk to me about it? Was I that unapproachable and guarded that they weren’t comfortable talking to me? Or were they just being unnecessarily passive aggressive? 
                             When I tried to discuss certain household issues, they just politely responded to my questions in order to stop me from talking further. Through the first year of university, my roommates only validated my mindset that everyone was too different from me.</p>
                             <p>I sat alone for most of that first semester. Every night, my debilitating anxiety kept me up until the crows started shrieking at dawn. In class, I couldn’t understand any lectures because I wasn’t used to the thick Indian accented English. The teacher’s unintelligible mumbles lulled me right to sleep during every class period of the day. 
                             The Indian heat and humidity, along with the absence of AC drained me of all my energy, and I felt fatigued and restless. In my mind, I was still in America, refusing to accept my change of environment. I knew I couldn’t spend four years just all by myself. 
                             I needed to find some common ground with literally anyone that could show me the ropes and help me adjust among everyone else in this new environment.</p>
                             <p>I couldn’t live in my own bubble disconnected from everyone else. I was here in India, and I needed to adapt somehow some way. I needed to break out of whatever self-superiority I was feeling to make friends and engage with my surroundings a little bit more. 
                             For starters, I needed to sit next to anyone who could decipher the lectures for me, answer my questions, and just talk to in class. The next morning, I mustered all my courage, grabbed a chair, and plopped down next to two girls in my class that I barely knew. I 
                             told them that I had to sit next to someone just to stay awake and maybe actually pay attention to the lectures for once. They happily scooched over and made some space for me at their desk.</p>

                            <p>As an Indian American in India, I felt both liberated and restricted. Everyone pronounced my name correctly on the first try; no one gave me stares as I walked into a store with a kurta on; 
                            no one asked me if I spoke Indian or Hindu or Islam; no one thought I was Native American; no one complained about smelly curry and samosas, and most importantly no one assumed I was smart just 
                            because I was Asian.</p>
                            <p>Communication, however, was a problem. We were all from different states, so friend groups formed mostly based on language. This was odd for me, because in the US, friendships formed based on interests and general get-along-ability. 
                            Between me and my high school friends, our overlapped interests and our collective South Asian immigrant experience pulled us together, whether from Tamil Nadu or Bihar. Upon coming to university, I realized that not all Indian people had the same “Brown” experience in India. 
                            People from Kerala were very different from people from Andhra Pradesh, and this was just in South India. </p>
                            <p>The two primary groups at my school were those that spoke Malayalam and those that spoke Telugu. Inside these huge groups, there were smaller subgroups based on class and major. 
                            A third group formed that mainly had North Indians, Northeast Indians, South Indians that moved to the North, or North Indians that moved to the South. Mostly everyone in this third group knew Hindi. 
                            In bigger cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi, friendships work similarly as the West where people connect with those with shared interests, regardless of language and state. My university, however, is far from an urban area and people fell into the comfortable familiarity of their own language to find their people.</p>
                            <p>In class, people transcended these language-based groups and talked to all their classmates in either English or Hindi. 
                            We were stuck with our class the whole day, six days a week, for four years, so we’d make small talk, discuss assignments, 
                            quizzes, and projects, complain about professors, and tease the designated class jesters. Circumstances pushed us together 
                            over the course of 4 years, so this was definitely the “friends just because I see you every day” type of friendship. 
                             all hung out occasionally after class to eat out and to celebrate birthdays, but everyone stuck with their groups for more fully fleshed out friendships.</p>
                            <p>Where did I fit in?</p>
                            <p>I was in Kerala, so instinctively, the first people I approached were those native to Kerala. Within the first week, I could tell that the friendship would not evolve past surface level. 
                            Whenever I’d make small talk and try to get to know them, most politely responded to my questions in English and returned to their previous conversation in Malayalam. Not many were interested in speaking a language outside of their comfort zone. </p>
                            <p>With the Telugu crowd, there was more of a connection. My family is from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, so I understood Telugu, but couldn’t speak it- as the classic first-generation immigrant struggle goes. Even though I told people that I understood Telugu, they didn’t believe me. 
                            Telugu people were more open to speaking in English, but even when they did revert back to Telugu, I still understood and kept up with the conversation. I wasn’t completely able to relate to their experiences, so I never entered their “squad,” but some eventually became my very good friends. 
                            Honestly, shout out to them for helping me improve my Telugu.</p>
                            <p>The last group, “Hindi Miscellaneous,” as I like to call it is the one I inadvertently ended up bonding with the most. After the first couple months, I became pretty good friends with a couple people in my class who spoke Hindi. They then introduced me to their friends of other majors, 
                            who I kind of got along with. Our experiences, perspectives, and tastes were similar, and they did sometimes speak in English with me, at least more than the others. Although there was a solid foundation for friendship, it was hard to build on it. Nothing instantly happened. It wasn’t an 
                            “omg we instantly clicked” situation. It took one and a half to two years for everyone (including me) to truly open up.</p>
                            <p>A hindrance to building friendship lied in my general Americanness. At this point, I talked freely to those around me, but some simply weren’t comfortable around me. Some people had a very set notion of what it meant to be American vs Indian, and because of preconceived notions, 
                            they couldn’t find a way to connect, and they ended up being hesitant around me. I saw these people super comfortable and open with others, but when I started talking to them, they immediately sobered up. It reminded me of myself back when university just started.</p>
                            <p>Some people just straight up couldn’t to talk to me. One day, one of my friends sat me down and relayed a message for me from some of our other mutual friends. The message wasn’t even a big deal, so I was surprised they couldn’t talk to me themselves. 
                            When I asked her why the rest of them couldn’t talk to me directly, she didn’t have a direct answer. She said something along the lines of “Oh, they just didn’t know how to tell you this” and “They were just hesitant to bring this up to you.”This lack of directness while speaking (as exhibited by my roommates as well) seemed to be an Indian specialty. </p>
                            <p>Another part of the problem lied in language. I couldn’t speak or understand Hindi. I barely knew Telugu in the US. When I talked to people one on one or in small groups of three or four, they usually spoke in English to accommodate me. 
                            In that situation, if the conversation naturally slid back to Hindi, I had no problems stopping them and asking them to translate. But when larger groups of people started hanging out, it became an issue. 
                            I desperately wanted to understand what everyone was saying, but it felt wrong (and kind of colonialist) for me, an American, to come to India and insist on Indians to speak English instead of their native tongue. Every time I asked for a translation, I felt guilty for being a burden. 
                            They’d have to stop the whole conversation, tell me what each person had said, and the conversation would be in English for approximately 30 seconds until they naturally switched back over to Hindi. Although I was among people, I was completely alone. Anticipating this, I declined invitations to go out, and indulged myself in a little (a lot of) self-pity. 
                            I locked myself in my room and curled up in blankets on my bed watching YouTube compilations of Parks and Rec to distract myself from the numbing alienation. 
                            I was reluctant to express this concern to anyone else, just because it felt silly and entitled to complain about such a thing- “I can’t understand Hindi, everyone should speak in English just to accommodate ME!” 
                            I did end up telling a couple people, and they were sympathetic, but ultimately, they couldn’t do anything about it which I completely understood.</p>
                            <p>Language was only one issue. Even if I did understand what was going on, I couldn’t relate to common conversation topics. 
                            They kept up with traditional tv shows like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Friends, and Big Bang Theory, while I gravitated towards more niche American content- Parks and Rec, The Good Place, Psych, etc. 
                            Music tastes were different; coming from Atlanta, I regularly listened to up and coming hip hop and rap artists, but most of my Indian peers weren’t familiar. Not to mention that I knew about 1% of all Indian music while my friends had practically every song in their memory. 
                            With Bollywood movies, I liked the very NRI tailored movies (Dil Bole Hadippa, Kal Ho Na Ho, Aaja Nachle) while my friends discussed more authentically Indian movies like Gangs of Wasseypur. I’ve heard so much about Gangs of Wasseypur for over four years now; I still haven’t seen the movie, but y’all, what’s the hype about? Someone explain pls. 
                            Even while talking about class and assignments, I didn’t understand what they were complaining about or who they were making fun of. What was a class topper? Why do you make fun of someone for being smart? I remember people getting frustrated trying to explain the difference between a rough record and a fair record because I just couldn’t understand. 
                            Why do you need to write the same information in two books?</p>
                            <p>India’s perception of America (pre 2020) is all big houses, nice cars, a relatively clean environment, and maybe a more progressive society, so some people did admire my accent, my experiences, and just my general American vibes. 
                            It didn’t help me bond with people though because they still distanced themselves, just saying “bade log, bade log” whenever I talked about anything remotely American. In their eyes, I was all “high class high status,” but I had never experienced that, living as a middle-class immigrant family in the US. 
                            Even though I now (after four years of living here) realize that I do have considerable privilege in India, I wasn’t raised with that sense of entitlement. </p>
                            <p>I desperately wanted to grab their shoulders and yell, “I AM NOT BADE LOG. EVEN THOUGH I SAY “YOGURT” INSTEAD OF “CURD” OR “DAHI,” I TOO GREW UP IN A MIDDLE-CLASS INDIAN FAMILY. NOT ALL PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE SUPER RICH AND PRIVELEGED. 
                            I AM JUST LIKE YOU WHY CAN’T YOU SEE THAT.” When I brought this up in more refined language, people were reluctant to acknowledge the sentiment, but my peers did eventually understand (I hope).</p>
                            <p>By the time fourth year rolled around, I could pretty much understand everything in Hindi, and no longer needed anyone to translate. Friendships formed through a cultural exchange of sort. They shared their stories and introduced me to the media they consumed, and I did the same. 
                            As time passed, we realized that we all had similar tastes, but also enjoyed discussions in which we all had wildly different perspectives. And of course, university gossip brought us all together and sealed the deal. Some people, however, were still hesitant to talk to me even after three years, but by that point, I had my people. 
                            I (mostly) no longer cared about what other people thought. </p>
                            <p>As any other college student, I had good days and bad days at school. Towards the end of university, I fell into a routine, and with the increased responsibilities of my career, projects, and grades, my relationship with the people around me was no longer a cause of my everyday stress. 
                            Once in a while, however, something would trigger my impostor syndrome whether it was hanging out in big groups (which almost always left me feeling alone), seeing my friends bonding better with each other than with me, or being forced to work with and talk to people who didn’t take me seriously. 
                            As much as I tried to channel my inner Independent Woman Who Don’t Need No One™, the fact that I was in a completely different country with no sense of familiarity or support whatsoever took my bad days to new lows. </p>
                            <p>Many of you are probably waiting for a final verdict of some sort. Was all that worth it? Was this whole thing a good experience or a bad one? I honestly don’t know y’all. I learned a lot, but at the end of the day, it is what it is. I have friends now though, so that’s a relief. </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">A Reckoning with Indian Culture and People.</div>
                            <p>Apart from the Man vs Man conflict I faced while making friends, the more overarching conflict of my university experience was Man vs Self. I constantly dwelled on the questions: “Am I too Indian?” and “Am I Indian enough?” 
                            Even though in my mind, I was one of the most Indian Indian Americans in the US, everyone, regardless of what city or state they were from, questioned my Indianness. This inevitably led me to rethink my Indian American identity in relation to the Indian identity of others.</p>
                            <p>Up until 6th grade, I lived in an area with few South Asians. Fitting in and making friends with my fellow Black, Hispanic, and White peers came easily, but I always had to manage my Indian-ness. 
                            Starting from kindergarten, many kids asked me, “Do you speak Indian” and “Eww what is that, it smells so bad,” and basically every other version of those two questions. I vividly remember kindergarten me trying to explain to my friends that my dad actually wasn’t wearing a skirt, but a pancha (dhoti in Hindi) when he dropped me off at the bus stop this morning. 
                            I realized early on that these questions just stemmed from curiosity, so I wasn’t embarrassed of my roots, just tired.I wasn’t ashamed of being South Asian, and I never hated my culture; I just had to water it down in public to make it more palpable for those around me. </p>
                            <p>In high school, however, things changed. The school in general was aware of South Asian and East Asian culture, so even getting along and connecting with people that weren’t South Asian was easy. 
                            Everyone acknowledged each other’s cultures, but also kept in mind that everyone is so much more than just their ethnic backgrounds. I found my place in a group of Indian Americans where we all embraced our shared experience of being Indian in a western world. 
                            The Indian American commonality that I used often to connect with many of my Indian peers wouldn’t work here in India. Everyone is Indian here.</p>
                            <p>I had a set idea of what it meant to be Indian (people raised in India) vs American (people raised in America). My parents and a lot of my South Asian Americans friends’ parents were strict in many aspects of their parenting. I led a very average Brown girl high school life. I studied, I hung out with my friends, spent time with my family and family friends, and that was it. 
                            No partying, no drinking, no relationships, and especially no unsupervised trips with friends. I didn’t feel compelled to do all that stuff anyway. My parents were more lenient than others; they gave me all the freedom I wanted, trusting me that I wouldn’t do anything crazy, and I didn’t. I knew my boundaries and didn’t dare cross them.</p>
                            <p>It’s also obviously just a huge Asian cultural thing to have strict parents, so I assumed that parents in India were even stricter because they were in the motherland. When I went back to India to visit just a handful of times, I was young and met only a few people that were my age- just a couple cousins and neighbors that I used to play with. 
                            My lack of experience in India and Hollywood propaganda of poor and/or fobby (adjective of FOB) Brown people had me thinking that all Indians were conservative, shy and naïve.</p>
                            <p>So at the beginning of university, when fellow students started telling me about all the bars and clubs they went to, all the relationships they’ve been in, all the types of alcohol they’ve tried, and all the adventurous trips they went on, I was shocked. That’s not Indian!? India isn’t a liberated country like the US!? People are supposed to be oppressed here! Indian people don’t do that kind of stuff! 
                            These initial interactions shattered all my notions of what it meant to live in India. I distinctly remember calling my friends in Atlanta and telling them, “This is crazy, we’re so lame compared to people here.”</p>
                            <p>On top of my disbelief, my peers were surprised that I hadn’t done all that stuff, living in the US. That my high school experience wasn’t like Riverdale or High School Musical. I was the conservative, clueless FOB in this situation. After recovering from my embarrassment of being so narrow minded, I began to reflect. 
                            My initial mindset that only the West was liberated and free surprised me. I’ve always associated this imperialistic attitude with ignorant nationalists, but it seeped into my 1st generation immigrant psyche as well. The hard lines I drew separating India and America started to blur.</p>
                            <p>I didn’t know Indian people and their experiences, but I did know other Indian things. My brother and I watched Bollywood movies and attended Balavihar; we regularly went to temples and ashrams, we attended and hosted pujas, we learnt classical Carnatic singing, and almost every day, we read and discussed the great scriptures and epics of Hinduism. 
                            All of this “Indian-ness”, however, was unintentionally hidden behind my American accent, body language, and mannerisms. Most people assumed I was a whitewashed Indian American, much like Rahul’s perception of Tina when she comes from London to start her first day of college.</p>
                            <p>Not many had met an Indian American, so they were surprised that I knew a lot about India. I remember asking some of my friends what the dining hall had for snack time, and they struggled to explain it to me- saying it was some sort of fried wheat snack. 
                            I thought they didn’t know the food’s name and didn’t know how to explain it, so when I went down and saw papdi, I was like, “How do they not know what this is? Papdi is so universal, and all Indians know what papdi is.” I got back to my friend’s room and said “Y’all this is just papdi.” 
                            They responded with “Oh you know what this is? We know what papdi is but, we thought you didn’t know what papdi meant so we were just trying to describe it to you.”</p>
                            <p>Another time, I went to someone’s room to get a movie. She was talking to someone on the phone, so when I entered the room, she discreetly said in Telugu, “Wait, someone came to my room.” 
                            The person on the line must have asked who came into the room, so as the movie copied onto my flash drive, she again said in Telugu, “If I say her name, she’ll know we’re talking about her.” Although I told her multiple times before that I understood Telugu, she straight up didn’t believe me.</p>
                            <p>While discussing Hinduism and its epics and scriptures, many were shocked to realize that I know just as much, if not more, than them.</p>
                            <p>Small incidents like these kept happening, and once again, I could tell that it didn’t stem from bad faith. We were all just trying to work through our preconceived notions. I didn’t really care enough to go out and actively prove anything to anyone, but I did feel feelings whenever these incidents happened. I was too Indian through most of my childhood, but now people thought I wasn’t Indian at all. Other people dictated my identity. 
                            To quote THE Raja Kumari, “Sorry that my sari ain’t Indian enough, and America don’t love me cause I’m Indian as fuck.”</p>
                            <p>I do want to admit that I was painfully oblivious to certain things regarding Indian society AKA things that people would only know if they lived in India. Once in class, we discussed the local trains and their often impatient, unruly passengers who just pack themselves into compartments without exactly following the rules. 
                            I piped up and said, “It’s just the lack of respect; if people had basic respect for each other, they’d be more patient and understanding, and they’d form a line and get on these trains in a civilized manner.” One of my classmates immediately shot me down and said something along the lines of “It’s not that most people who travel on these local trains don’t have respect; they’re usually people of lower class who don’t have the luxury of being ‘civilized.’ 
                            Missing a train could result in severe consequences like getting fired or leaving their family to go hungry.” He was right, and I had a lot to learn. </p>
                            <p>A lot of people saw my American-ness as ignorant and naïve, and although my American background didn’t really help when I tried to make friends, it wasn’t completely looked down upon. </p>
                            <p>I didn’t bring any western style clothes from the US because I thought that people in India mostly wore Indian clothes. Kurtas are easy breezy, and I’ve only worn them for special occasions in the US, so I was excited to wear them all the time in India. Our university encouraged everyone to wear kurtas just because it’s located in a conservative area, so I was in the clear, but some of the other girls only brought western style clothes. 
                            As I listened in on conversations, many proudly claimed that they “don’t even own any kurtas” because it’s all “urban and modern near my home” and how the kurta is “old and outdated.” They looked down upon the kurta because it was too traditional and therefore “backward,” making it not modern and cool enough to wear daily. When did casual Indian clothes go out of style in India?</p>
                            <p>In the US and the West in general, the first-generation immigrant conversation revolves around showing off our culture in a place that shuns it. To embrace our authentic selves and to not hide our identities to appease white society. Not everyone in India actively looked down upon their own cultures, but enough did for me to take notice. I came from a reclamation to a resistance. </p>
                            <p>I just want to clarify and say that South Asian culture isn’t perfect. Toxic societal norms (casteism, classism, racism, religious intolerance, the patriarchy, etc.) permeate through South Asian culture, and we should actively reject these structures, but what I’m referring to are the more superficial aspects- fashion, language, and media. </p>
                            <p>Many made fun of those who couldn’t speak proper English and even deemed them as less intelligent. Some shamed others for needing subtitles while watching English movies. Western movies, TV shows, and fashion were the benchmark of “culture.” Discussing US politics and laughing at Trump’s latest shenanigans meant you were well read and intelligent. </p>
                            <p>Even though the liberal Indian experiences and perspectives surprised me (at first), I never thought twice about the Indian accent or the traditional clothes. Those things are just a part of India. Nothing wrong with that. When I heard other Indian people complaining about these things, I thought “If anyone’s going to complain about India not being like the West and India being behind, it should be me, an American- not you guys. 
                            If I don’t have a problem with people being in touch with their traditional roots, why do some of y’all have an issue?”</p>

                            <p>My preconceived notions about the motherland pretty much just fell away within my first year of university. At the same time, my American ignorance and ego popped like a safety pin to balloon, and honestly, I’m so grateful for that. In terms of my identity and what it really means to be Indian or even American, I can say with 100% confidence that there’s no right answer here. 
                            In some situations, I’m a complete Indian FOB, but in others, I’m a spoiled American brat. Even today, when people in India ask me where I’m from, I struggle to answer. Do I really feel like getting into how I was raised in the US and then I moved back to India for university or should I just say Hyderabad and be done with it? One thing I definitely came to terms with is that I can’t express the whole of my identity at all times. 
                            Many versions of myself exist, and they’re all just different authentic parts of my identity. We’re dynamic, we’re learning, we’re growing, and we’re never going to be able to just put ourselves in a box and say, “This is definitely who I am at all times.” Not everyone is going to get that, but if you’re comfortable with who you are, that’s all that matters. 
                            That and kindess. People who were kind to me unknowingly lifted me out of some very dark times. Kindness has the power to change lives.</p>
                            <p>Having lived in both the US and in India as a normal every day person, many people ask me, “Where do you prefer living, the US or India?” or more bluntly, “Which is better, the US or India?” These, my friends, are loaded questions more suitable for another time.</p>
